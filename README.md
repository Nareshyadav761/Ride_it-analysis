****Main Insights****

Low conversion: Only 24% of requests turn into completed rides.

PHV dominates: It drives most of the trips, so optimising PHV has the highest impact.

High passenger cancellations: Mainly due to long wait times or sudden fare changes.

Driver imbalance: Most drivers work in PHV, making taxis less available.

Top driver gap: Best drivers complete 1,500–2,000 rides, others much less.

Demand fluctuates: Ride volumes rise and fall across days, affecting availability.
